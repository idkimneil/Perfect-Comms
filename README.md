Perfect Comms makes voice chat feel like part of the match. Players talk in-game, hear the people around them, find voice-ready lobbies, and play with voice rules that fit the way Among Us is actually played.

<br>

## Why Players Use It

- **Voice built into Among Us**, no Discord or mute bots
- **Extremely immersive proximity audio**
- **Optional Meetings & Lobby Only mode** for a simpler setup
- **Role-specific voice behavior**
- **Built-in voice lobby discovery**
- **Simple in-game controls**, plug and play

<br>

## How It Works

**Proximity by default.** Everyone talks through their own mic and hears each player by how close they are in-game, clear up close and quiet at a distance.

**The host tunes the round.** Hearing range, wall and vision occlusion, ghost and meeting rules, and a meetings-only mode are all host options, so each lobby plays how its host sets it.

<br>

## Supported Mods

Perfect Comms works on its own as a proximity voice mod. Some mods unlock extra voice behavior, integrations activate automatically when the mod is present and stay dormant when it is not.

| Mod | Voice behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TOU-Mira** | Blackmailer, Jailor, Parasite / Puppeteer, Swooper, and Glitch mutes.<br>Crewpostor impostor voice rules.<br>Medium ghost voice modes.<br>Muffled hearing for Eclipsal, Grenadier, and Hypnotist effects.<br>Team Radio for Impostors, Vampires, and Lovers, with keybind cycling. |

<br>

## Settings

| Hosts set the match rules | Players set their own audio |
| :--- | :--- |
| Talk distance, falloff, and occlusion | Mic and speaker device |
| Vent, ghost, and meeting voice rules | Push to talk or open mic |
| Team Radio channels | Noise suppression, echo cancellation, auto gain |
| Role-based mutes (with supported mods) | Per-player volume and HUD layout |

<br>

## Install

1. Install **BepInEx 6** (Unity IL2CPP build) into your Among Us folder.
2. Drop `PerfectComms.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins`.
3. Launch Among Us. Open Perfect Comms from the Options menu (`F10`). Hosts open Voice Settings from the lobby game-settings console (`F11`).

BepInEx/
└─ plugins/
   └─ PerfectComms.dll
```

Perfect Comms is fully standalone. It installs in the same `BepInEx/plugins` folder as mods that do use Reactor or MiraAPI (such as TOU-Mira) and runs alongside them without conflict.
