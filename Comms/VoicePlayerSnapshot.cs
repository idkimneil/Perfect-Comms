// How the LOCAL player's proximity-hearing origin is relocated this frame.
//   None             - normal: hear from your own body.
//   PuppeteerSwap    - TOU Puppeteer drives the victim (own body frozen): hear ENTIRELY from the
//                      victim's surroundings. Gated on the built-in PuppeteerHearFromVictim host toggle.
//   ParasiteAdditive - TOU Parasite hears its own body AND the victim's surroundings (union, louder
//                      wins). Gated on the built-in ParasiteHearFromVictim host toggle.
//   ExternalReplace  - PerfectComms.Api listener-origin override (Replace). Hear ENTIRELY from the
//                      override position. NOT gated on any built-in/TOU toggle - works standalone.
//   ExternalAdditive - PerfectComms.Api listener-origin override (Additive). Hear from own body AND
//                      the override position. NOT gated on any built-in/TOU toggle.
